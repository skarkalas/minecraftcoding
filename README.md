# Minecraft Coding

**Minecraft Coding** is a learning environment designed to help people develop computational and spatial thinking.

Learners are given the option to play `Minecraft` using `Blockly` to build their environment.

`Minecraft` is used as a creative playground for learners that want to experiment with automations and geometry in an exploratory 3D space.
